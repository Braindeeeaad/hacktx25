## Requirements

- **Node.js** v16+ (v18 recommended)  
- **npm** or **Yarn**  
- **Expo CLI** (`npm install -g expo-cli` or use `npx expo start`)  
- **ngrok** *(optional, for connecting the mobile app to the local backend)*

---

## Setup & Run (Local)

### Backend (Server)

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev   # or: npm start
```

If using TypeScript compilation:

```bash
npm run build
node dist/index.js
```

If testing on Expo Go, expose the backend to your phone with ngrok:

```bash
# Example: expose port 3000
ngrok http 3000
```

### Frontend (Expo App)

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
npx expo start
```

Scan the QR code with **Expo Go** (on iOS or Android).  
If the backend runs locally, update your frontend `.env` or config to use either:
- Your **LAN IP** (`http://192.168.x.x:3000`), or  
- The **ngrok URL** generated earlier.

---

## Environment Variables

Create `.env` files in both `backend` and `frontend` directories.

**Example ‚Äî backend/.env**
```
PORT=3000
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
JWT_SECRET=your_secret
```

**Example ‚Äî frontend/.env**
```
API_BASE_URL=https://<your-ngrok-url>
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_KEY=your_api_key
```
