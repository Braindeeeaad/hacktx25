# 🔑 API Key Setup - Direct Configuration

## ✅ Changes Made

The module has been updated to use a **direct API key configuration** instead of environment variables. This makes it much easier to set up and use.

## 🚀 How to Set Your API Key

### Step 1: Get Your Gemini API Key
1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy your API key

### Step 2: Update the Code
1. Open `src/ai/gemini/analyzeSpending.ts`
2. Find this line near the top:
   ```typescript
   const GEMINI_API_KEY = 'your-gemini-api-key-here';
   ```
3. Replace `'your-gemini-api-key-here'` with your actual API key:
   ```typescript
   const GEMINI_API_KEY = 'AIzaSyC...your-actual-api-key-here';
   ```

## 📝 Example

```typescript
// Before (placeholder)
const GEMINI_API_KEY = 'your-gemini-api-key-here';

// After (with your actual key)
const GEMINI_API_KEY = 'AIzaSyC1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz';
```

## ✅ Benefits of This Approach

1. **No Environment Variables**: No need to set up `.env` files or environment variables
2. **Direct Configuration**: API key is right in the code where you need it
3. **Easy Setup**: Just replace one string and you're ready to go
4. **Clear Error Messages**: The module will tell you exactly what to do if the key isn't set

## 🔧 Validation

The module includes built-in validation that will:
- Check if the API key is set
- Verify the key isn't the placeholder value
- Ensure the key has a reasonable length
- Provide clear error messages if something is wrong

## 🚨 Security Note

For production use, consider:
- Using environment variables for security
- Storing the API key in a secure configuration file
- Using a secrets management service

For development and testing, the direct configuration approach is perfect!

## ✅ Ready to Use

Once you've set your API key, the module is ready to use:

```typescript
import { analyzeSpending } from './src/ai/gemini';

const analysis = await analyzeSpending(transactions);
```
